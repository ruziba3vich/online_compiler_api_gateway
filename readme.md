# ðŸ§  Online Compiler API Gateway

This project is an **API Gateway** for a gRPC-based online code compiler service, built using **Go (Golang)** and **Gin**, with streaming support for real-time code execution results.

---

## Project Overview

The API Gateway acts as a bridge between the front-end client (e.g., a web interface) and the back-end gRPC compiler service (e.g., a Python code executor). It provides a **WebSocket endpoint** that allows users to stream execution results of submitted code in real-time.

---

## Features

- **WebSocket API** for live code execution
- **Streaming support** â€” output is sent as soon as it's generated
- **gRPC Client** communicates with the backend compiler service
- Graceful startup/shutdown via **Uber FX**
- Modular and clean codebase using layered architecture

---

## WebSocket Endpoint

### `GET /execute`

This WebSocket endpoint handles real-time communication. Clients can connect and send source code to be executed. The response (output or errors) will be streamed back as they are generated.

---

## Code Format

To execute code, the client must send it in the following format:
```
CODE:
<your code goes here>
```


**Example:**

```
CODE:
print("Hello, my telegram channel is t.me/Soliyev_talks")
```


> !! Note: If the format is invalid or missing `CODE:` prefix, execution may fail.
